Based on Game theory proposed by John Horton Conway
<ul>
  <li>Zero-player game.
</li>
  <li>Evolution is based on game rules
</li>
  <li>Universe is infinite (orthogonal grid of square cells) with binary state 
</li>
  <li>Interaction with 8 neighbor cells
</li>
  <li>Each live cell goes through underpopulation, overpopulation or stable state and dead cell reproduction or stable state
</li>
